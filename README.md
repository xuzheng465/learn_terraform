# Quick start


Configure your [AWS access 
keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) as 
environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

Deploy the code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

When the `apply` command completes, it will output the public IP address of the server. To test that IP:

```
curl http://(server_public_ip):8080/
```

Clean up when you're done:

```
terraform destroy
```
