Please note that this code was written for Terraform 1.x.

## Quick start

**Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. We have made every effort to ensure 
all the resources qualify for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), but we are not responsible for any
charges you may incur.** 

Configure your [AWS access 
keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) as 
environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

Specify a name for the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table in `variables.tf` using the `default` parameter:

```hcl
variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket. Must be globally unique."
  type        = string
  default     = "<YOUR BUCKET NAME>"
}

variable "table_name" {
  description = "The name of the DynamoDB table. Must be unique in this AWS account."
  type        = string
  default     = "<YOUR TABLE NAME>"
}
```

Deploy the code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Clean up when you're done:

```
terraform destroy
```
